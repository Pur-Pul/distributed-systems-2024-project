# Distributed Systems Project 2024

Current bugs:
- When loading page, right-most column might be cut in half. When scrolling, the boxesPerRow gets recalculated and the column gets removed, messing up any drawing made. (Doesn't need to be fixed for prototype)

How to run frontend:
- npm install
- npm start
- open http://localhost:5173/ (might be different if that port is taken)
